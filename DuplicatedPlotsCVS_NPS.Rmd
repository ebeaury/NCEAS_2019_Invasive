This code is meant to find a list of unique IDs of duplicated plots between NPS and CVS

Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(lubridate)
```

Importing raw data from CVS
```{r}

```

Importing NPS list of Site, Plot, and Year
```{r}

```


Maybe the next steps should be
- list of parks
- filter them from the `Author Observation Code` from CVS
- count observations per plot for both datasets
- compare plot IDs, Year and number of observation
